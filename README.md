# Dataset-for-the-MCS-MEMOP-Framework

This dataset contains the data used in the research paper titled “Developing Robust Management Pathways for Nutrient Pollution Management in Watersheds Under Climate Uncertainty.” The included data are essential for reproducing the results and analyses presented in the study.

The repository is organized into the following files:
Figure 4: Data illustrating the performance of MOP, SMOP, and MEMOP solutions, including values for the three objectives and four selected solutions
Figure 5: Data showing the performance of MOP, SMOP, and MEMOP solutions under epoch-specific constraints.
Figure 6: Data presenting the unit removal costs associated with MOP, SMOP, and MEMOP solutions.
Figure 7: Data showing total cost, TN, and TP loads for MEMOP solutions under each of the 13 climate scenarios (C1–C13).
Figure 8: Data illustrating the performance of MEMOP solutions across multiple climate scenarios, evaluated using robustness metrics.
Figure 9: Data showing the performance of MCS-MEMOP solutions under newly introduced climate conditions.

All files are provided in Excel format and correspond to specific sections of the manuscript. For further details on how the data were applied in the analyses, please refer to the relevant sections of the paper.
